This "example" directory contains a configuration file that enables
you to run standalone jules from the command line. This directory and example
directories for the other applications within the LFRic code
repository are colloquially called "canned" configurations as they are
designed to be run from the command line straight out of the can
without needing to run the Rose Stem application.

To run them without using Rose Stem, check out a working copy of a
branch. Then:

$ cd r12345_workingCopy 
$ ./build/local_build.py -a jules # Builds jules and copies it to bin directory
<snip lots of output>
$ cd applications/jules/example
$ ../bin/jules configuration.nml ;# Runs jules with the configuration file as input

To ensure canned configurations are kept up to date with changes to
the application, the Rose Stem developer test suite tests the canned
configurations to ensure they run to completion without errors.

configuration.nml
----------------- 

This file holds the application configuration. It configures a "single
point" run of jules. It is configured to use the mesh file in
this directory which is, in reality, not a single point mesh, but a
2x2 biperiodic mesh. However, the configuration is designed in such a
way as each point is computed independently from the other points
and, in fact, gives identical results for each point. 

As this configuration is tested routinely with the Gnu compiler, it
is always expected to successfully run to completion. Note that it
should be run single-threaded as jules does not currently support
running with OpenMP. In practice, it means that either the jules
executable must be built without applying OpenMP transformations
(which is the default) or the application should be run with a single
thread, such as by setting the environment variable OMP_NUM_THREADS=1.
