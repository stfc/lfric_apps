description=Low-level critical Froude Number
help=The low-level critical Froude number is the Froude number

    =larger the depth over which the blocking drag is applied.
    =
    =According to linear theory, the critical Froude number
    =should be ~1.0. However, most operational configurations
    =use a value of 4.0, as smaller values can lead to excessive

!enumeration=true
help=Setting this to 'dry' means that the dry value of the buoyancy
    =frequency (Nd) is used everywhere.
    =Setting this to 'lowmoist' means that Nmoist is used to calculate
    =the low-level flow blocking drag and the total wave stress in a column,
    =while using Nd to distribute that wave drag in the vertical.
    =Setting this to 'moist' means that Nmoist is used everywhere in the scheme.
    =Latent heating due to moist processes is accounted for by estimating how
    =much of the sub-grid orographic displacement is saturated, and then
    =calculating a weighted average of the dry and saturated values of the
    =buoyancy frequency.
    =This is physically more realistic for moist air masses and reduces the
    =buoyancy frequency N.
